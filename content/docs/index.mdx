## Introduction

**Many UI** is a collection of beautifully designed, customizable components you can copy and paste directly into your projects. These components are flexible, accessible, and open-source.

This is **NOT a traditional component library**. Instead, it's a toolkit of reusable components meant to empower you to create a unique, scalable UI without dependency constraints.

### What do you mean by not a component library?

Unlike traditional libraries, Many UI is not available as an installable npm package. You won't add it as a dependency; instead, you choose and integrate only the components you need by copying and pasting them into your codebase. This approach gives you full control over customization, so the components truly feel like part of your application.

**Use Many UI as a foundation to build your own tailored component libraries.**

## Philosophy

I firmly believe that excellent design plays a crucial role in the value of software. It's one of the primary ways to build trust with users, especially when interacting with people online. Trust is vital for online businesses because it's the first thing a potential customer assesses before deciding to make a purchase or provide their payment details.

Bad design negatively impacts your team's reputation. It gives the impression of being careless, incomplete, and unreliable. It signals that the team lacks consideration for the user experience.

Effective design suggests that the team is organized and capable. It builds confidence that they will deliver quality work moving forward.

**Designed for seamless compatibility with leading frameworks**, our solution empowers developers to streamline their workflow and create with ease.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>
  <strong>Why copy/paste and not packaged as a dependency?</strong>
</summary>

The idea behind this is to give you ownership and control over the code, allowing you to decide how the components are built and styled.

Start with some sensible defaults, then customize the components to your needs.

One of the drawbacks of packaging the components in an npm package is that the style is coupled with the implementation. _The design of your components should be separate from their implementation._
