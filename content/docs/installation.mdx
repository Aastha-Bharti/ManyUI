Install and configure Next.js to work with Many UI components.

## Next.js

### Create project

Start by creating a new Next.js project using `create-next-app`:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

### Run the CLI

Run the `shadcn` CLI to setup your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```text
Which style would you like to use? › New York
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Neutral
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › yes
```

### App structure

Here's how I structure my Next.js apps. You can use this as a reference:

```text {10-13,15-17,20}
.
├── app
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── page.tsx
├── components
│   ├── ui
│   │   ├── button.tsx
│   │   ├── card.tsx
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── auth
│   │   ├── login-form.tsx
│   │   └── signin-form.tsx
│   └── ...
├── lib
│   └── utils.ts
├── hooks
│   └── use-mobile.tsx
├── public
└── styles
    └── globals.css
```

- I place the UI components in the `components/ui` folder.
- The rest of the components such as `<LoginForm />`, `<NavBar />` are placed in the `components` folder.
- The `lib` folder contains all the utility functions.
- The `hooks` folder contains all the custom hooks.

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx {1,6} showLineNumbers
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
